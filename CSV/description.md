# CSV Parsing Scripts

## File Path

Make sure to upload the data file via (main Screen Skyspark Tools > File > Upload). The file path will then be "`io/uploads/YOUR_FILE_NAME".

## Specify Column Names

First column should be where the time stamps/references are. Second should be the value we are measuring/tracking.

## Setup parseDateTime

Look up https://skyfoundry.com/doc/axon/CoreLib#parseDateTime for references on the date format codes.
